Title:	SkipList implementation in c++ using generic programming

Skiplist is a data structure used to store sorted list of items, very much like Binary Search Tree.

Sorted associative containers like set and map which are implemented using height balanced binary search tree can be implemented using SkipList to achieve better performance in certain cases.

Rationale:
1. The main advantage of using Skiplists over Balanced trees is that it is better suited for concurrent access.
2. The algorithms for insertion and deletion in skip lists are much simpler and faster than the equivalent algorithms for balanced trees.
3. Balanced tree algorithms rearrange the tree as operations are performed in order to maintain certain balance conditions and assure good performance but this is not required in case of SkipList.
